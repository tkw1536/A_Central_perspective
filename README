# A Central perspective
This template is heavily based on the original template "A_Centered_Perspective" by Anymorphic. 
I have merely updated it to be compatible with the new version of DokuWiki. 
The original page and template can be found at https://www.dokuwiki.org/template:a_centered_perspective. 
The original template can also be found in the initial commit of this repository, which only cahnegd this file. 

# Changelog
* added Japanses language from https://www.dokuwiki.org/template:a_centered_perspective
